# DateCapture Pro 2000 - Date Picker

A retro-inspired **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** app that simulates a camera interface for capturing dates using animated dials, knobs, and a digital viewfinder. Made as an entry for Bad UX World Cup. The goal was to design a date picker with as bad user experience as possible.
